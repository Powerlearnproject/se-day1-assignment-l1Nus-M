    - Economic growth: Software engineering creates many jobs, and drives economic growth, by the creation of new technologies, and the maintainance of current technologies.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

--The "Software Crisis" and the Birth of Software Engineering (Late 1960s): 
This period was characterized by the "software crisis," where software projects frequently exceeded budgets, missed deadlines, and produced unreliable software. In response, the NATO Software Engineering Conferences in 1968 and 1969 played a crucial role in establishing software engineering as a distinct discipline.This milestone emphasized the need for a systematic and disciplined approach to software development, moving away from ad-hoc programming practices.

--The Rise of Structured and Object-Oriented Programming (1970s-1980s):
Structured programming emerged as a way to improve code clarity and reduce complexity. Techniques like modular design and top-down programming gained prominence. Later, object-oriented programming (OOP) revolutionized software design by introducing concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Languages like C++ and Java became popular, solidifying OOP as a dominant paradigm.

--The Internet Age and Agile Methodologies (1990s-2000s):
The rise of the internet and the World Wide Web transformed software development, leading to the creation of web applications and distributed systems. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, emerged as a response to the need for faster and more flexible development processes. Agile emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and customer feedback, allowing teams to adapt to changing requirements.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

--The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that outlines the steps involved in developing software from initial concept to final deployment and maintenance.
--Phases of SDLC:
    - Planning: This phase involves defining the project scope, goals, feasibility analysis, and resource allocation. It sets the foundation for the development process.
    - Requirement analysis: This phase focuses on gathering and documenting the detailed requirements of the software. It involves: Collecting information from stakeholders (users, clients, etc.), analyzing and documenting user needs and creating a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.
    - Design: In this phase, the software's architecture and design are created based on the requirements. It involves: Designing the system architecture, designing the user interface (UI), creating detailed design specifications, and choosing the appropriate technologies.
    - Implementation (Coding): This is the phase where the software is built using programming languages and frameworks. Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. 
    - Testing: In this phase, the software undergoes various tests (unit testing, integration testing, system testing) to identify and fix bugs, ensuring it meets requirements and functions correctly.
    - Deployment: The tested software is released to the end users. Deployment can be done in stages, such as beta releases, to minimize risks.
    - Maintenance and support: This ongoing phase involves providing support and updates to the software after deployment. It involves: Fixing bugs and addressing user issues, releasing software updates and patches, sdding new features and enhancements, and monitoring system performance.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
--Waterfall Methodology:
    - Linear and sequential: Each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance) is completed before the next one begins.
    - Rigid and structured: Changes are difficult and costly to implement once a phase is complete.
    - Emphasis on thorough planning and documentation upfront.
    - Suitable for projects with well-defined and stable requirements.
Example scenario: Projects with fixed requirements: Such as government projects or systems with strict regulatory compliance.

--Agile Methodology
    - Iterative and incremental: Development is broken down into short iterations (sprints).
    - Flexible and adaptable: Changes can be easily incorporated throughout the development process.
    - Emphasis on collaboration and customer feedback.
    - Suitable for projects with evolving requirements and uncertainty.
Example scenario: Projects with changing requirements: Such as web development or mobile app development.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

--Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining text prompts to effectively communicate with and elicit desired responses from large language models (LLMs) or other AI systems.
--Some key aspects of prompt engineering include:
    -Enables Customization for Specific Use Cases: Prompt engineering allows AI models to be tailored for different applications, such as customer support, education, or coding assistance. 
    -Enhances Accuracy and Relevance: Well-structured prompts reduce ambiguity, helping AI generate more precise and meaningful responses. 
    -Improves Creativity and Problem-Solving: Carefully crafted prompts can steer AI toward generating innovative ideas or structured solutions, making it valuable in content creation, software development, and brainstorming.
    

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

-- Vague prompt example: Write a story.
-- Improved prompt example: Write a 300-word short story set in a dystopian future where artificial intelligence governs society. Focus on a protagonist who risks everything to challenge the system, highlighting themes of freedom and human resilience.
--The improved prompt is more effective because it provides a clear subject and genre. The prompt clearly defines the setting and context which directs the writer towards a specific character world. It gives specific guidelines, by specifying the desired length. This ensures the piece is concise and manageable. It provides a focused narrative direction, by providing a clear direction for the plot and charachter development. Finally, the improved prompt has reduced ambiguity as opposed to the vague prompt. With detailed criteria, the writer knows exactly what elements to include, which can lead to more cohesive and engaging story.
